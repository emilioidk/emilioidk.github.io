##Keffe Fair alternative design
Mid 2015 I was hired by a coffee shop in Aalborg called Kaffe Fair. They needed to update their webpage, to look more modern and professional, and to attract people with their content. As I was free to design and propose different options I came up with two solutions.<!--more--> They picked the one you can currently see at [kaffefair.dk](kaffefair.dk) and below you can check a video with the main characteristics of the alternative proposed. Below the video are some keywords of the alternative's qualities.
