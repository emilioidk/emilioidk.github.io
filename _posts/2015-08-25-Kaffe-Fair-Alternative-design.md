##Keffe Fair alternative design
Mid 2015 I was hired by a coffee shop in Aalborg called Kaffe Fair. They needed to update their webpage, to look more modern and professional, and to attract people with their content.<!--more--> There were two designs that I implemented, they picked the one you can currently see at [kaffefair.dk](kaffefair.dk) and below you can check a video with the main characteristics of the main alternative proposed. Below the video are some keywords of the alternative's qualities.
