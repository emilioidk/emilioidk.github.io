  <p>I love working with computers and am always looking for new oportunities. Recently I have been working a lot with web development (both frontend and backend) with great interest in responsiveness. I've used different frameworks like Bootstrap, JQuery, Foundation, Skeleton and others. You are welcome to pick up a PDF copy of my CV at the top of this page, or go ahead and check out my portfolio below. </p>
