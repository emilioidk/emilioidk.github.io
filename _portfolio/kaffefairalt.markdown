When assigned the project of re implementing Kaffe Fair's webpage, I came up with a few designs that where proposed to the client. After one design was chosen, I proceeded to develop it but also to develop this one, for a matter of practice and entertainment.

The implementation of the backend was done in Umbraco while the frontend used mostly Bootstrap and JQuery. While the implementation never made it out to the internet, the experiment was interesting and I learned quite a few things while doing it. I recommend you look at the video underneath showing it's main characteristics and [contact me](mailto:emilio@lundgaardlopez.com) if you have any questions.
