The project consisted in using WordPress to create a new design for the existing page for PGA of Denmark. The back office continued to be in Odeum CMS while the team in charge of it took the implemented WordPress instance to re implement the frontend. The result is a responsive page that adds space for new characteristics to the base theme used for the development.

The base theme is [customizr](https://wordpress.org/themes/customizr/).

The implementation is currently up and running at [pga.dk](http://pga.dk).
