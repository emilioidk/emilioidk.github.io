I was assigned to re implement Kaffe Fair's homepage. Their webpage was outdated and needed to get modernized. They were also interested in having Umbraco as backoffice, because that was the system they had been using until the moment. An important point was to have a responsive final product that would also work in as many devices and browsers as possible. Several designs were considered but in the end, this one was chosen for the implementation.

It features a navigation bar that toggles to a dropdown menu when the width of the windows gets too small. It also includes an image gallery that can be manipulated through the backend, allowing the client to pick the images they want to display.

The CSS was developed without the need of frameworks. Nevertheless the result was an extremely responsive webpage. It was as well very well modularized in order to optimize file sizes and allow code to be reused both in the same project and in future ones.

Unfortunately the webpage is now offline but if you have any questions about it, you can always [contact me](mailto:emilio@lundgaardlopez.com).
