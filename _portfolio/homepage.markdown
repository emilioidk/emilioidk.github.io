I decided to take advantage of GitHub's capabilities to make myself a homepage. It uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which makes it quite fun to work with. It renders files written in Markdown and the template engine Liquid makes it super easy to develop easy to use solutions.

I decided to make a small design using GIMP before going ahead with the developing. I uploaded the files of the design to [this respository in GitHub](https://github.com/emilioidk/homepage-design).

While there are certainly several points I need to work on, I am happy with the final product. The CSS was written manually without the need of any framework and it aims to make responsiveness seem easy. I tried to keep the code as structured and modular as possible, which should come in quite handy when making changes, as well as for reusing code in future projects.

The result is the beautiful, responsive, lightweight personal homepage you are looking at right now!
