### Development skills

#### Front end

I have used several tools and frameworks when it came to _front end development_. For example, I've used  [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/), [JQuery](https://jquery.com/), and others. I like keeping modularity in my applications because it provides reusable, debuggable, clean code.

I have experience with graphich tools such as Gimp, Inkscape, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Illustrator.

#### Back end

The tools and frameworks used for back end development are naturally divided into three categories: server, application, and database.

As most of my experience developing back end is in Linux, my favorite means of serving used to be the Apache Webserver although I have used several small lightweight servers mostly for development stages. Recent applications provide an integrated server that can be used both at development and production stages, for example Express for Node.js.

Back end application come in several forms. The languages I have used for back end are PHP, Python, and Ruby, as well as Javascript when developing applications for Node.js.

My experience with databases is mostly using MySql though I have experience installing and setting up instances of Microsoft SQL Server.

#### CMS development

I have experience installing and maintaining different CMS. I have worked with WordPress for a long time and recently started developing in Umbraco CMS.

#### Formal methods

Some formal methods languages or techniques I have studied are Statecharts, Z, CSP, and TLA+.

#### Network and domain management

I have experience working with DNS settings as well as diagnosing networks and connections.

#### Operating Systems and IDEs

I am experienced with Linux with which I've worked since 2006. I have used the operating system (in different distros) for programming as well as for managing systems, diagnosing and monitoring external stations, and for daily personal use. I know how to use a terminal and worked with several IDEs for example: Sublime Text, Vim, Atom, Eclipse, and, most recently, Visual Studio Code.

My experience with Microsoft Windows includes developing in Visual Studio and using different tools as WebMatrix, IIS, and XAMPP.

#### Virtualization

I have experience creating and managing virtual machines with Virtual Box.

#### Versioning

Normally I use Git to keep versions of my development under the best practices. I also have experience using SVN.
